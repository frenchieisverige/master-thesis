I would like to express the deepest apprecetion to my first evaluator, Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Stefan Traub, who has always his office open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about my research or writing. He consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but didn't hesitate to put me in the right the direction whenever he thought I needed it. \\

I would also to give a special thanks to Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Markus Sch{\"a}ffter for his spontaneous agreement to act as the second evaluator. I am gratefully indebted to him for his very valuable comments on this thesis. \\

I owe many thanks also to my colleague and now friend, Florian Schneider for his collaboration. Some parts of our respective thesis required a lot of team work. I'm so grateful that we could achieve a fantastic job together. \\

Last but not least, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and to my girlfriend Jill, for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you!
